      Help Increase the Peace Project
    </header>
    <p>
      The Help Increase the Peace Project (HIPP) is a youth leadership program created by the Nobel Peace Prize-winning American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) in 1991. HIPP is an interactive program made to address issues of interpersonal violence, prejudice, and injustice with participants of all ages, especially middle- and high-school age youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      HIPP uses examples from participants’ own life experiences, the news, and history to cultivate the power of decision-making, alternatives to violence, and the belief that we are all agents of positive social change.
