        The Film
      </header>
      <p>
        Paper City is a feature-length documentary about the American Dream and the school-to-prison pipeline—the nationwide phenomenon in which high school dropout rates coincide with mass incarceration of urban youth. Set in Holyoke, Massachusetts, a post-industrial city once known for its thriving paper industry, Paper City follows Iesha Ramos, a college student born and raised in Holyoke who returns to her old middle school every day to run her afterschool program for arts and leadership, the Teen Resource Project.
